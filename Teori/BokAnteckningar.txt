Internet have a five-layer architecture: The application, transport, network, link and physical layers. 

Chapter 1 Computer Networks and the Internet

	End systems are connected together by a network of [Communication links] and [packet switches]. 

	Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the [ Transmission rate ] of a link measured in bits/second.

	When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as 	[ packets ] in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data. 

	A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Packet switches come in many shapes and 	flavors, but the two prominent types in today's Internet are [ Routers ] and [ Link-layer switches ]. Both types of switches forward packets toward their ulitmate destinations. 
	
	End systems access the Internet through [ Internet Service Providers (ISPs) ]. 

	End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run [ Protocols ] that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The [ Transmission Control Protocol 	(TCP) ] and the [ Internet Protocol (IP) ] are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. The internet's principal protocols are collectively known as [ TCP/IP ]. 

	End systems attached to the Internet provide an [ Application Programming Interface ( API ) ] that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infratructure to deliver 	data to a specific destination program running on another end system. 


	In our human protocol, there are specific messages we send, and specifi actions we take in response to the received reply messages or other events.
	It takes two (or more) communicating entities running the same protocol in order to accomplish a task. 


	Person 1				Person 2
	   |		Hi			   |
	   |-------------------------------------->|
	   |			Hi		   |
	   |<--------------------------------------|
           |	Got the time? 			   |
	   |-------------------------------------->|
	   |			2:00		   |

	A [ Protocol ] defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or 	other event.

	Devices connected to the internet are often referred to as end systems. 
	End systems are also referred to as hosts because they host (that is, run) application programs such as Web browser program, a Web server program, an E-mail client program, or an E-mail server 	program.
	Hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories: [ Clients ] and [ Servers ]. 

	HFC uses a combination of fiber cable and coxial cable. DSL and Ethernet use copper wire. Mobile access networks use the radio spectrum.
