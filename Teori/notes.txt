The features or services of the network are implemented in distinct "layers". For example, sending '1' and '0' across a wire, fiber, etc. is done by the physical layer.
Organizing the '1' and '0' into chunks of data and getting them safely to the right place on the the wire is done by the data link layer.
Passing data chunks over multiple connected networks is done by the network layer.
Deliverying of the data to the right software application at the destination is done by the transport layer. 

Service Data Unit(SDU) is a unit of data that has been passed down from an OSI layer or sublayer to a lower layer. This unit of data (SDU) has not yet been encapsulated 
into a protocol data unit(PDU) by the lower layer. That SDU is then encapsulated into the lower layer's PDU and the process continues until reaching the physical layer 
of the OSI Stack.
